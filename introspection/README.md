Why must we choose you?

I realise that there is heavy competition, but I believe I will be one of the better recruits for the AmoFOSS club. I have always been interested in programming and open source projects.
Once armed with knowledge, I am ready to help others. I do well in leadership positions if that matters for the future, but I am also good at sitting back and learning from better people. 
I will be a dedicated and active member of this club.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

I am looking into learning Android app development and understanding Game engines. I will be prepared to learn what the club has to offer.

How would you contribute back to the club? 

I am happy to organise programs and events because I enjoy managing things. I am good with helping others if they need it.
I will participate in competitions and events relevant to the functions of the club.

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

I'm not entirely a fan of the process. I enjoyed doing them, but I also felt like I wasn't learning anything as well as I should. 
I think a better strategy would be to create fewer tasks which delve better into the concepts.
